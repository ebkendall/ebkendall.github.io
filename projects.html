<h2> Game of Life Direction </h2>
<p> By clicking on a box/cell, you will either make the cell living (white)
    or not living (black). Then once you have the starting configuration
    you like, hit the START Button to run the Game of Life! You can stop
    the process by hitting the STOP Button as well. Check out the
    Wikipedia page for interesting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Examples_of_patterns"
        target="_blank"><b>designs and patterns</b></a>. At any point when
    the process is paused, you may click on a cell and change it manually
    to dead or alive and create any pattern you would like and then press
    play. (Much of the inspiration for these JavaScript projects are from
    <a href="https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/" target="_blank"><b> The Coding Train</b></a>)
