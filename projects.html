        <h1> Game of Life Directions: </h1>
        <p> By clicking on a box/cell, you will either make the cell living (white)
            or not living (black). Then once you have the starting configuration
            you like, hit the START Button to run the Game of Life! You can stop
            the process by hitting the STOP Button as well. Check out the
            Wikipedia page for interesting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Examples_of_patterns"
                target="_blank"><b>designs and patterns</b></a>. At any point when
            the process is paused, you may click on a cell and change it manually
            to dead or alive and create any pattern you would like and then press
            play. (Much of the inspiration for these JavaScript projects are from
