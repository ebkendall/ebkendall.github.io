		<h1> Game of Life Directions: </h1>
		<p> By clicking on a box/cell, you will either make the cell living (white)
			or not living (black). Then once you have the starting configuration
			you like, hit the START Button to run the Game of Life! You can stop
			the process by hitting the STOP Button as well. Check out the
			Wikipedia page for interesting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Examples_of_patterns"
				target="_blank"><b>designs and patterns</b></a>. At any point when
			the process is paused, you may click on a cell and change it manually
			to dead or alive and create any pattern you would like and then press
			play. (Much of the inspiration for these JavaScript projects are from
