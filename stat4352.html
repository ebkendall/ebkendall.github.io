The intended pace is roughly one homework per week. According to the UT Dallas Handbook of Operating 
Procedures "Semester Credit Hour Value" (see <a href="https://policy.utdallas.edu/utdpp1090" target="_blank"><b>UTDPP1090</b></a>), 
each assignment should take approximately 6 hours to complete because this is a 3 credit hour course 
and "[o]ne semester credit hour indicates an hour of instruction and at least two hours of study time 
per week per credit in a session or semester." If you find that a particular problem is taking 
especially long to solve, then move on to the other problems, and follow up with either the TA or 
myself for guidance on the problems you could not solve.
